# easy-bouncycastle-util
A wrapper for bouncycastle java lib for easy using

-------------------------------------------------------
bouncycastle is a great java lib but hard to use. This lib is for using bouncycastle easilier.

Though the name is "easy-bouncycastle-util", this project does not only include utils which wraps bouncycastle but also includes some algorithms supported by provider of JDK. It could be considered as a package of test cases of crypto algorithms.

By now, done things are below:
* Gnu pgp
* ECDSA
* AES
* some basic utils such as: Base58, Hex, Digest(SHA-1, SHA-256, RIPEMD, MD5)

All work is for make crypto easilier.
